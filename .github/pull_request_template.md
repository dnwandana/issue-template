1. Always set the pull request as a draft until it is ready to be reviewed.
2. Add clear and concise description of what you did and fix issue number if applicable.
  
    Example:

    - fix: #[issue_number]
    - #[issue_number]

    or even better with description, like:

    - add: ... (fix: #[issue_number])
    - change ... (fix: #[issue_number])
    - update ... (fix: #[issue_number])
    - remove ... (fix: #[issue_number])
